### 3) Why is it important to choose a license?
> Licensing is important because it defines the permissions related to intellectual property. It defines who\
> is allowed to distribute the work, who is allowed to buy the work, and who is allowed to modify the work.\
> For open source software, these specifications are important.\

### 4) Why is it important that you SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?
> You shouldn't use a project that doesn't have explicict licensing, because the lack of details in licensing\
> puts you at risk of doing something that you may not have permission to do. For example if you distribute code\
> That is not strictly licensed for distribution, then later, should that code gain a license, you could be in\
> trouble for having distributed the code.\

### 5) Failure to follow the Open System Model - "Why the web beat Gopher"
> Goper did not have his system open during the development phase for the protocol. He closed off the development\
> to himself and his team, rather than opening up the development to the larger community. I think that opening\
> the code for development is a good idea because the more contributions there are by diverse authors, the better\
> the code will be, and opening up early versions of the prduct for development can help to gain a follwoing for\
> that tech.\

### 6) Why does Android use an Apache license?
> Android writes that it is about freedom and choice. The purpose of Android is to promote openness in the mobile\
> world, and they can't predict or dictate all the uses for their software. So, while Android encourages everyone\
> to make open and modifiable devices, they don't think it's our place to force them to do so. Using LGPL \
> libraries could be restrictive in a few ways:
> LGPL requires the allowance of customer modification and reverse engineering for debugging those \
> modifications. Most device makers don't want to be bound by these terms.\
> Historically, LGPL libraries have been the source of many compliance problems for downstream device makers \
> and application developers. Educating engineers on these issues is difficult and time consuming. It's \
> critical to Android's success that device makers can easily comply with the licenses.\
