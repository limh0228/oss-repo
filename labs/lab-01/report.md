 ## Free Culture Chapter 3
 > This article emphasizes the importance of information freedom. When certain organizations and corporations own intellectual properties or ideas, they are given legal license to bully small players in innovation. This impedes the development of technology, and allows well-funded players to use their ownership as an excuse to squeeze profit out of an unfair system that puts individuals at a disadvantage. It seems that the driver for ownership is money, not the progression and distribution of technology. Not such a noble cause.

## Reflection
One Open Source project I'm interested in is called OpenStreetMap. It's a webapp that creates a map of data about roads, trails, caf√©s, railway stations, and much more, all over the world. They do this using public contributions, aerial imagery, GPS devices, and low-tech field maps to verify that OSM is accurate and up to date. This Open Source project looks interesting because I think I can use it for my RCOS project, the Forge Machines map.
